The project I'm proposing is a reservation program for places like hotels, amusement 
parks or restaurants or anything that is required to stay. My project will combine a fake hotel 
called we-stay inn with different activities and types of rooms. And at the start of the program 
there will be a welcome and then a list of services and types of rooms, then the user will be able 
to look at each option and see which one they like and pick it, and the activities they will like. 
There will be a list of activities and starting time. Before the user books the room, there will be a 
message telling them how much the night with a brief description of the room is. If the user 
changes, there will be that option. Some inputs that the program will have are the variety of 
rooms, cost, and activities. There will also be a function calculation for all services and 
experiences. There will also be a place for the user to input their name and credit card 
information. The program will output a confirmation message with all the details of their stay 
such as check in and check out, as well ant activities if they picked any.  I also want to put a 
function that organizes everything by dates and if the date is the same by first and last names. 
The problem that this program will solve l hotel's organization problem. This will also make it 
easy for user to book and get to know the hotel better. In conclusion, I plan to make a 
reservations program for a hotel with activities and rooms.
